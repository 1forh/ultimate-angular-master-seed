## Setup and install

Fork this repo from inside GitHub so you can commit directly to your account, or simply download the `.zip` bundle with the contents inside.

#### Dependency installation

During the time building this project, you'll need development dependencies of which run on Node.js, follow the steps below for setting everything up (if you have some of these already, skip to the next step where appropriate):

1. Download and install [Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for Windows or for Mac.
2. Install firebase CLI on the command-line with `npm install -g firebase-tools`
3. Install Gulp CLI on the command-line with `npm install -g gulp`

That's about it for tooling you'll need to run the project, let's move onto the project install.

#### Project installation and server

Now you've pulled down the repo and have everything setup, you'll need to `cd` into the directory that you cloned the repo into and run some quick tasks:

```
cd <master-seed-app-folder>
npm install
```

This will then setup all the development and production dependencies we need.

Now simply run this to boot up the server:

```
npm start
```
